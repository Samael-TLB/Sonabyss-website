<h1>Sonabyss 2019 Website</h1>
<p>This code repo contains the files for my university annual cultural fest (2019) website.  The website 
is a fully functional, modern-looking and fast loading website.</p>
<p>The folder is structured intuitively with the main entry point being <b><i>index.html</i></b>. The web 
pages for the various events of our fest are presented in html files of the same name.  The file hierarchy 
and dependencies are simple and intuitive. The website has been designed using html, css, php and javascript
only.</p>
<p>The website is integrated with user registration and management. It also has vote polling capabilities.</p>
<p>All in all the website is a complete product and can used as such for rapid development and serving.</p>
